<p><!-- Is technology *the* supreme danger? (Heidegger) --></p>

<p>According to Heidegger, modern technology is not just dangerous but is rather <em>the supreme danger.</em><label for="sn-id-heidegger" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-heidegger" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Heidegger, Martin. 1977. “The Question Concerning Technology.” In <em>The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays</em>, New York: Garland. </span></p>

<h2 id="the-supreme-danger">The supreme danger</h2>

<p>The primary issue is not that we are being manipulated by propaganda or distracted by screens. These are only minor illustrations of a much more drastic and long-running historical change: that the rise of modern technology has already fully captured our most basic human capacities, that our very access to being and living true lives, may have already been strictly barred from us. I ask you to take this possibility seriously. <em>What if</em>, for some ambiguous and concealed reason you’ve never quite been able to put your finger on, before you were even born, something far out of your control has blocked you from being?  Have you ever wondered why some of the most basic human activities, such as speaking honestly and directly to others, sitting in silence, taking walks for no reason—these are things that humans have done over thousands of years, but today many of us cannot even do them when we try (which we don’t), or if we can we find them too mentally challenging and exhausting to be worth doing. I am not romantically glorifying some pastoral, peasant life; I am only saying these things appear to be increasingly unavailable to most of us today; I am saying that <em>surely this is odd</em>. I mean, isn’t it odd, that we find it hard to <em>just be?</em> As human beings, to live and to be should be the easiest and most natural thing in the world, right? We might have all different kinds of challenges and problems pertaining to our <em>goals</em> or <em>projects</em>, and we might suffer pains and tragedies; but most of the time, by default, we should feel at home in <em>just being,</em> for it is our most basic birthright as human beings, to just be. But today we don’t feel at home in being; when we try to <em>just be</em>, we can’t. We feel like we need to do a bunch of things in order to belong in the world, we have to get good marks in university, we have to find the right people, we have to say the right things, we believe that if we do the right things <em>then</em> we can just be, but even when we are doing all the right things, whenever we try to just be, we feel empty and restless and are immediately thinking about what we have to do next (even if it’s as simple as thinking about what your next line of banter should or should not be when you’re supposed to be relaxing with friends). It is very odd. To sit in silence with a moment of free time, looking out a window perhaps, <em>should</em> make us feel completely content and satisfied and full of being, for in such a moment being is all we are doing and being is all there is for us to do as human beings. But we can barely do it, and if we can, we feel nothing. And if you think this problem stops as you get older, let me tell you, it doesn’t. I think many older people only come to accept their own impossibility of being, they typically do not grow out of it; so if you know what I’m talking about, do not think you can put this problem off. You have to solve it now, or possibly you will solve it never; the earlier in life the better, as your mind and attitudes and behaviors are more pliable now than they will be later. Every passing year the person you are is more and more likely to be the person you will be from there on out, it seems to me. So what I am talking about here is very serious and concrete and practical, deadly serious, because it has to do with whether you will really live lives or simply keep plowing through a foggy mist of perpetual alienation and frustration.</p>

<p>So it is very odd, very puzzling, that we are human beings but today just <em>being</em> seems increasingly out of reach. Many people blame themselves, “I’m just weird,” but no, you’re not weird, it’s pretty normal to think there’s something weird or wrong about you. Everyone suffers from this constant feeling of not belonging anywhere, but survival in our society requires that you pretend you are fine, so you come to figure that <em>you</em> are just a crazy mistake of the human species because everyone else seems fine but only <em>you</em> can’t just be. In the modern era, many people feel like this. So this is very odd, is it not?</p>

<p>This oddity—that we are beings who cannot just be—should make us wonder whether perhaps something happened, somewhere along the line of human history, something very wrong? Well, a long line of thinkers have argued that what happened was a cluster of changes which we might simply summarize as “modern technology.” One specific subset of modern technologies is what we might call, loosely, “modern media technology,” or just “media” for short. I am not saying we should try to go back to peasant lives in which we’d feel “at one with nature” or any such absurd romantic nostalgia. There is no question of going back to any golden age, the only question is how to <em>go through</em> modernity, given the possibility that our very being has already been colonized by technology. At present we have only sought to setup the puzzle, and later we will, of course, try to make progress on multiple possible solutions. For now I would like to leave you with a glimmer of one possibility.</p>

<p>Heidegger says that for us to go through our current historical impasse, we must first see this supreme danger for what it is.<label for="sn-id-heidegg2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-heidegg2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Heidegger, Martin. 1977. “The Question Concerning Technology.” In <em>The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays</em>, New York: Garland. Page 41. </span> So while you do not have to agree with everything I just said, you at least have to understand what I’m getting at and you have to be able to at least <em>assume that it’s true.</em> Assume it is true, and think about everything that would mean, if it were true. That’s the first step. Next Heidegger says that you should be able to find and enter that place of belonging. The next step is that you have to <em>turn,</em> however slightly or uncertaintly, you have to try to turn your attention, turn your direction, away from all the million things you are usually turned toward, and instead turn yourself toward where you dwell. And where you dwell is in your own thinking. And you think in language, don’t you? So whereas today you are constantly asking yourself “What shall we do?” you must now ask yourself, “How must we think?” You need to think about that, honestly, for yourself, with no evidence other than your own thinking or experience. By doing this, you are preparing the only ground on which true being could ever possibly arise from its current imprisonment by technology.</p>

<p>He says it will be like when you get over grief or pain. You know how you used to cry about that person who dumped you but now you couldn’t care less? That’s what it should feel like when you fully understand and surmount the hold that modern technology has on your being. Maybe, I don’t know. If you were expecting a more exciting solution where we’d escape the clutches of technology through some dramatic revolutionary action, perhaps you will find Heidegger’s suggestion underwhelming. But if you find it underwhelming then perhaps it is because you are so deep in the clutches of technology, that your expectations are those you bring into the cinema? And that perhaps Heidegger’s suggestion is indeed the most dramatic of revolutionary actions imaginable, but that you cannot quite see that, yet…</p>

<h2 id="acceleration-inequality-deception">Acceleration, inequality, deception</h2>

<p>So information, intelligence, negentropy, capitalism–these all seem to have a certain consistency or affinity, reflected in the attempted meta-science called cybernetics. Intelligence and capitalism, we have noted, both have a circular, cybernetic structure. Modernity appears to follow an explosive pattern as a result of positive feedbacks between technology, economic growth, human intelligence, and human institutions. The more intelligent humans become (and IQ does increase over time),<label for="sn-id-flynneffect" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-flynneffect" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">“The Flynn effect is the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from roughly 1930 to the present day.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect </span>, the more adept they become in extracting profits (or the more “value they are able to create,” depending on your political ideology). In turn, the more profit and advanced economic enterprises and institutions we create, the more intelligent we become. Or at least, the amount of intelligence we bring under our control increases, even if it exceeds our individual intelligences, and even if an even greater quantity of intelligence escapes us. The same could be said of the relationship between technology and economic growth, which is why Nick Land refers to them together as “techonomics.”<label for="sn-id-teleoplexy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-teleoplexy" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Land, Nick. 2014. “Teleoplexy: Notes on Acceleration.” In <em>Accelerate: The Accelerationist Reader</em>, eds. Robin Mackay and Armen Avanessian. Falmouth, United Kingdom: Urbanomic Media Ltd. </span> All technological advances are so fully harnessed for economic purposes that they can hardly be said to exist independently from the economic apparatus. And economic activity is always a technological or instrumental orientation to the world, so it can hardly ever not be technological.</p>

<p>We might now begin to ask, what is the purpose of laying out such concepts as intelligence and rationality in such a broad, high-level view of the modern period? The reason is–or least one reason is–that it helps us see that almost nothing about modern politics is what it pretends to be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accelerationism identifies the basic diagram of modernity as explosive… It is the firm prediction of accelerationism, therefore, that the typical practical topic of modern civilization will be the controlled explosion, commonly translated as governance, or regulation.<label for="sn-id-teleo2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-teleo2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Land, <em>Teleoplexy</em>. </span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If modernity is world-historical explosion, characterized by runaway intelligent processes tearing asunder the human social fabric, then modern government could not be the sophisticated technocratic process its suited representatives pretend it is. It now looks to us more like an old, dirty band-aid slapped on a fatal snakebite by provincial bumpkins either too stupid to understand snakes, or in shocked denial about their rapidly festering, gangrene leg. Not only will such bumpkins be too late with a solution that doesn’t work, but in the meantime they will affect the demeanor of a competent and triumphant doctor. Not because they know what they are doing but precisely because they have no clue, and the consequences of their ignorance are so dire as to be otherwise existentially unendurable. If you understand the horror show of modern politics as an uncontrollable explosion, with the left and the right understood as temperamentally different, deceptive linguistic coping mechanisms, dozens of more specific political puzzles seem to solve themselves.</p>

<p>For instance, how is it that, for almost the entire career of the concept of “democracy,” the term had a negative connotation – basically meaning chaos and social ruin – but suddenly at the turn of the 20th-century it becomes something that states are claiming to be. Historically, it had negative connotations, as something that governments and rulers were generally committed to preventing. For most of the term’s history, democracy meant something like today’s “anarchy,” and was essentially a code word for the uneducated mob expropriated the dominant and destroying civilization. Today, however, democracy is perhaps the most universal consensus norm in all of politics around the world, with an overwhelming majority of politicians across countries generally endorsing or at least paying lip service to the normative necessity of institutions such as elections, popular sovereignty, etc.  How did this become so widely accepted, even among elites and wealthy who have always had so much to lose from democracy, and have historically always known it? Well, if it’s really just a trivial little discursive band-aid slapped dishonestly on an explosion–through a kind of decentralized, evolutionary, cultural negotiation process of humans trying to paper over the most intolerable tendencies of the explosion, then it’s suddenly less puzzling.</p>

<p>What are the most intolerable edges of this explosion? The best method for identifying them is to think about the really hard problems that neither the left nor the right are really willing to discuss. One of the reasons we have already talked a bit about differences in human intelligence is that this is one of the left’s absolutely taboo topics. Why? Because accelerating techno-economic sophistication, most clearly indexed by information-communication technologies, exacerbates economic inequality as a function of unequally distributed human intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="skill-biased-technological-change">Skill-biased technological change</h2>

<p>The standard and fully formalized model for this process is called, in the economics literature, “skill-biased technological change” (SBTC).<label for="sn-id-sbtc" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-sbtc" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Skill-biased technological (or technical) change is “a shift in the production technology that favors skilled over unskilled labor by increasing its relative productivity and, therefore, its relative demand. Traditionally, technical change is viewed as factor-neutral.” Violante, Giovanni L., and Lawrence Blume. 2008. “Skill-Biased Technical Change.” In <em>The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online</em>, ed. Steven Durlauf. Palgrave Macmillan. <a href="http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000493">(Link.)</a>. The causal evidence is debated, e.g., Card, David, and John E DiNardo. 2002. “Skill Biased Technological Change and Rising Wage Inequality: Some Problems and Puzzles.” <em>NBER</em>. <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w8769.pdf.">(Link.)</a> </span> In a nutshell, if you’re good with computers, techonomic acceleration makes you richer, but if you’re bad with computers it genuinely threatens your survival.</p>

<p>This pattern is existentially unendurable for the compassionate left, so they’ll say and do anything to avoid this (not to mention the electoral problems with telling people this). The problem for the right is that we actually do have inescapable ethical obligations to each other, but it seems to me that techonomic acceleration makes it harder and harder for the relatively more Conscientious right-wing to sustain empathy with out-groups. So they’ll also say and do anything to avoid this. As a result, modern “Democracy” becomes a kind of negotiated settlement for a division of labor in deception, wherein the dominant pretend to care about the wishes of the weak masses, the left is permitted to speak and act as if everyone is equal, and the right is permitted to speak and act as if arbitrary and fictional boundaries such as the national or familial are real, objective realities.</p>

<p>If there is one political norm that approaches a semi-global universal, at least in the West, it is perhaps the idea that Democracy is a good thing. But this conventional wisdom about democracy is dubious at best. Much more plausible and empirically consistent is the interpretation that democracy as a concept in global political culture was primarily a strategic simulation evolved precisely to prevent the forward march of entropic tendencies, such as militant grassroot formations gaining strength in the first decades of the twentieth century (communism, anarchism, etc.). Elite-sponsored “Democracy” was an instrumental symbolic solution for confused primates confronting an unmanageably accelerating world. Historically standard geopolitical calculations, for elites and upstarts, were being confounded by systemic changes nobody could fathom and by lines of flight escaping the socius at a pace nobody could contain.</p>

<figure><figcaption>WWI was a technological bloodbath but many political elites did not realize this until it was too late. Failing to understand that machine guns and chemical gases would make this an entirely new kind of war, many officers marched into WWI wearing old-school ceremonial military garb from the Napeolonic era, as with the Austro-Hungarian Calvary depicted here.</figcaption><img src="http://jmrphy.net/media/assets/img/funnyhats.png" /></figure>

<p>In the history of democracy, as a rule of thumb, the only concessions ever made by elites to redistributing power were made at the same time as other shifts by the same elites, to move or secure their real power assets. Bicameralism is generally a reflection of this logic: Give power to the people in one house (the House of Representatives, the House of Commons, etc.) but create a second house to ensure elite veto power (the Senate, House of Lords). Let’s make a United Nations to constrain states from warring, but ensure that in the final analysis it does not have enforcement powers (which remain with the dominant states). Multicultural welfare states, as long as capital can easily move within and outside the country. Zuckerberg supports open national borders, as long as he can have gates around his community, etc.</p>

<h2 id="world-war-i-and-democracy-as-camouflage">World War I and democracy as camouflage</h2>

<p>One of the best examples of this is when the concept of Democracy first becomes a pop-cultural entity. If you look at data sources such as the Google N-grams database – which provides data on the frequency of word usage in a sample of all books written each year for the past few hundred years – the first significant uptick in the word “democracy” appears right around the time of World War I.</p>

<figure><figcaption>https://books.google.com/ngrams</figcaption><img src="http://jmrphy.net/media/assets/img/propaganda_democracy_ngrams.png" /></figure>

<p>Why is this? I believe the answer has to do with the concerted efforts by the Wilson administration to generate public support for American entrance into World War I. Wilson ran on a platform of remaining out of the war.<label for="sn-id-chomsky" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-chomsky" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Chomsky, Noam. 1991. Media Control: The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda. New York: Seven Stories Press. </span> After winning the election in 1916, he decided entering the war was imperative, but the public had very little interest in fighting what they saw as a European conflict. The burgeoning trade union movement and anarchist agitators such as Emma Goldman were generally opposed to the war. Also keep in mind that this was a relative high-point for militant left-wing political activity: a lot of aggressive anarchist bombings, the IWW, the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, etc.</p>

<p>One of the main propaganda tactics of Wilson’s propaganda team was elevating American republicanism in contrast to German military autocracy. The so-called Creel Commission, headed by George Creel, was arguably the first modern systematic propaganda campaign, if we understand by that the idea of using international mass communications network to shift public opinion on a particular, specific attitude. If you look at the propaganda at that time, it sought to generate militaristic loyalties by stressing the need to defend Democracy. But of course, up until then democracy was generally seen as a bad, fringe tendency on the fringes of proper political life. The concept of Democracy appears to have been launched as a piece of instrumental communication.</p>

<h2 id="ideology-as-instrumental-response-to-acceleration">Ideology as instrumental response to acceleration</h2>

<p>The larger point to see is that the concept of Democracy, as suddenly a good thing, was probably a well-intentioned solution to incalculable, complex, and genuinely terrifying political dynamics. Democracy appears to arise as a kind of ideological simplification device out of an exploding social fabric that has hopelessly escaped our comprehension. Moral memes in general may be defined by this dual function, of making excessively complicated and incomprehensible reality dynamics psychologically endurable for the masses while also orienting the drift of mass behavior toward the instrumentally attractive short-term priorities of those in the higher percentiles of intelligence and conscientious. Not because there is an evil cabal among elites of intelligence and conscientiousness, but simply because these two traits basically <em>are</em> instrumental rationality, so their priorities always lead the pack without the pack knowing it (hence why we must think of them as aliens come from the future, as discussed earlier). Whenever moral performances occur in public culture today, do they not always have this structure and effect: instrumentally gratifying for precisely those who are most hopeless to steer their own ship in increasingly chaotic waters, yet instrumentally convergent with the basic long-run interests of the techonomic elite? In the early days of mass communications systems, such moral grandstanding was restricted to elites because of their privileged access to central broadcasting. Today, as access to broadcasting becomes decentralized, political moralism proliferates wildly, and this basic pattern of strategic deception via moral righteousness continues through an increasing number of minds projecting their claims into a fragmented void. Of course, we see this in the fact that most moral claims or “virtue signals” on social media today are feigned expressions of knowledge or explanation, the real immediate function of which is to achieve some instrumental goal of the speaker (typically dopaminergic, e.g., getting clicks or likes for just a minor feeling of control), to make the chaos of reality feel better for their audience and themselves.</p>

<p>If this is correct, if in some sense moral claims as such function in the public arena as opaquely instrumental responses to the acceleration of complexity, then modernity is not just the explosion of complexity beyond our comprehension but rather turbo-charged complexity in positive feedback with the decentralized mass production of delusion (on top of the uncertainty intrinsic to complexity, which is bad enough). Thus, modern democracy is not at all what it pretends to be; it probably never had anything to do with devolving power to the masses. It is only one of many disingenuous and delusional conceptual innovations that are slapped like a band-aid on horrifically inhumane techonomic acceleration, reflecting the short-term instrumental interests of people in proportion to their objective sources of raw power. Except that, each layer of disingenuous conceptual gloss thrown up by humans makes it that much harder for humans to contact the reality of being. Seen from this light, the most ethically perverse communicative action one observes today is from those in possession of above-average intelligence &amp; conscientiousness, but below elite levels, whose objective intellectual firepower is not enough to beat or make robots, but is enough to fool the cognitively and temperementally disadvantaged. They are smart enough to convince themselves they are acting humanely in covering the public sphere with moral claims, but not smart enough (or time-rich enough to reflect on it) to see their participation in the acceleration of the species’ extinction. This is one reason why an “accelerationist” politics has no place for the Marxian tradition of “praxis,” let alone social justice activism: in the face of hopelessly unmanageable and inhuman–scale complexity, silence and inactivity is at once more intellectually and ethically sophisticated.</p>
