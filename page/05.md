## The politics of information processing power

One of my working hypotheses is that digitalism--basically, the human arrival at the ground-zero building block of reality--is one of the key causal conditions that made possible the wide variety of interlocking and generally "bad" social dynamics that ignited in the late 1970s and early 1980s. For instance, the rapid takeoff of within-country economic inequality, especially in the United States. The decline of militant, anti-systemic political protest. Increasing anomie, alienation, mistrust, mental health problems, etc. This marked increase in computational efficiency multiplied the social power of the already dominant individuals and institutions, in particular the state and the corporation. I think it was also a basis for the sociological sorting dynamics we would observe from then to today, as it increased the basic power of all people, including the technologically dominated masses, to identify, select, and separate (while it also increased the pressures to do so). It seems to me this has led at once to an elite dominance never before seen in the history of humanity, at the same time elites have never had less control. I think this is one of the most crucial over-arching transformations which characterize the history of most countries in the world from 1970 to today. Needless to say, this remains purely at the level of conjecture and hypothesis. But I think we should see if these theses could be demonstrated.
