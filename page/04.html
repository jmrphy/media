<!-- 

In earlier sessions, we indicated in a preliminary way what is meant by "the information revolution.” I would like to now spell out in more detail what exactly is so important and historically unique about this historical event. We have only begun to understand this, in ways that are only faintly hinted at in popular catchphrases such as the "computer age" or the "internet age," and so on. Rather, I think we are really talking about irreversible anthropological transformations, which have taken place in a fashion we are constitutionally incapable of processing.

First, I will try to explain in more detail what exactly the information revolution was, in a theoretically concise and empirically tractable way. Anything so broad and significant as an "information revolution" will, of course, have many debatable interpretations. I'm going to give you mine. Second, I will try to explain just a little bit of technical detail that I think it is necessary to understand: what exactly distinguishes the digital from the analog. If there is an essential technical aspect that defines the information revolution, it seems to me that it is digitalism. After I spell these things out, I will then--third--give you an outline of what I think the effects have been. All of them can be lumped under the umbrella heading of a generalized cultural shift in favor of instrumental attitudes and behaviors, at the cost of substantively rational attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, increases in information processing power increase the economic returns to instrumental rationality relative to substantive rationality, which leads to predictable economic but also ethical shifts in the culture at large. Especially when you understand that such cultural shifts will affect different types of people differently, in a different sequence, the past several decades suddenly make a lot more sense.

## The information revolution

If you chart out on a timeline all of the advancements in information processing that have occurred over human history, you find that most of them occurred in the past few hundred years. And most of those that occurred in the past few hundred years, occurred in the past few decades. This gives you a rough idea of what the information revolution was, in terms of its outputs: a concentrated onrush of technical things such as the transistor, the microcomputer, and digital signal processing, and then quotidian things such as cable television, fax machines, cell phones, handheld video recorders, the world wide web, and so on.

But can the information revolution be pinned down to a particular turning point, a time and place where a corner was turned? Well, the information revolution is one moment in the already explosive dynamic that is modernity, so there must be a certain arbitrariness in the attempt to identify the turning point. But with that caveat, I would venture to say that the information revolution can be most precisely specified as a relatively discrete set of scientific and engineering discoveries, made in quick succession, by a relatively small, elite network, whose concerted efforts were mobilized and disciplined by the war effort (WWII). The best candidate for a place and time representing the turning point of the information revolution would have to be the major research centers of the US, and to some degree the UK, during WWII. Primarily, the famous theoretical achievements of Claude Shannon and his colleagues at Bell Labs, in Holmdel, New Jersey, in the few years around 1948, and the overlapping achievements of figures such as Alan Turing at Bletchley Park in the UK.

Consider that Shannon's landmark paper was published in 1948. The transistor came in 1947, cellular telephone networks in 1947, transatlantic telephone cables in 1956, the laser in 1958, and the first orbiting communications satellite (1962), and from there it's off to the races. The explosion of technological innovations that would follow in the subsequent decades, and eventually define our world historical moment today, can be traced back to this concentrated set of discoveries, cyrstallized by the extraordinary external pressures of national survival. Now, if you go back over this time, and you try to understand what, if anything, is the unifying technical theme of these various innovations, it seems to me the answer is: the digital.

## Digitalism

So what is the digital? Well, it's not at all obvious. It's ubiquitous, but it's hard to say what exactly the digital means. So we should briefly review.

Analog technology works by physical analogy. A signal is transmitted by some physical process that mimics or corresponds to the signal, and the results of the physical process are interpreted. The human voice is a great example. We physically vibrate our vocal chords, affecting the air pressure entering into a listener's ear, and these changes in the air pressure are processed by the listener. There are a few characteristics of the analog process that make it unique. One is that an analog signal has a theoretically infinite resolution. It is a continuous variable, meaning that its value at any point in time can be any number on the real number line (this is infinite, think of all possible decimal values). Of course, our material apparatus cannot perceive infinite resolution: the human ear, for instance, cannot perceive infinitely fine variations in pitch, for instance. But still it seem highly significant, from a phenomenological perspective, that we know analog signals have a theoretically infinite resolution. I believe this is why there has always been, and there remains, a certain kind of romance around the analogue (e.g. vinyl records, face-to-face interaction). In a sense we are confronting the infinite, even if we cannot process it fully. Indeed it is this gap that is, somehow, most valuable, mysterious, enchanting, etc. In other words, there is something substantively or intrinsically worthwhile about receiving signals from the infinite. It maxes our capacities while also grounding us to our highly fallible, limited natures, which are ultimately incapable of fathoming the outside in its infinite expanse. In some sense, then, the popular romantic connotations of analog technology, I beleive, point to something real. Analog technology is more real in a very concrete sense, and it is more real because it exposes our finitude to the infinite. And this is intrinsically valuable experience because we are really finite, and the outside really is infinite.

Digital technology is subtly but crucially different. There is no physical analogy corresponding to a continuous variation. Rather, a continuous signal is converted to a discrete variable, meaning that it can only take one of a limited number of values, typically zero or one. This means that with the digital we are always talking about finite resolutions. The degree of resolution can be increased, but it must be finite. This reduction to a discrete variable is what allows the digital to become relatively free of physical limitations (obviously there is some physical apparatus, but the information transmission process no longer goes through a physical analogy). As we are talking about only zeros and ones, we are talking only about information, which can be stored. Any series of zeros and ones can be encoded and stored through electric pulses, then opened up in another time and place without any recourse to some physical process mimicking the signal.

Digitalism is perhaps the key technical aspect of the information revolution because it is the unifying thread for the most significant aspects of all the subsequent developments. Second, electronic miniaturization is predicated on digital compression. TVs are an intuitive examples. Analogue TVs used to be huge, because they contained cathode ray tubes that physically shot light into the TV screen's pixels. Today the typical TV has a flat-screen, because pixels are lit according to digital signals that do not require a physical apparatus acting analogically. Second, what is called technological convergence, or the tendency for multiple types of different media channels (radio, tv, cellular phone networks) to converge toward one meta-information channel (i.e. cyberspace). It seems to me that digitalism is a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for this convergent tendency. The separation of these various media platforms appears to have been a function of their being discovered and engineered through different physical analogies, which accounts for their relative autonomy and incommensurate forms through their earlier years; the digital allows them all to shed their physical-analogical encasements and merge into one platform in which all media are composed of the same nature: zeros and ones. Third, digitalism is therefore the key that unlocked our era's extraordinary geographical compression. It is because of miniaturization and convergence that nearly real-time global communication and command became possible. Last but not least, the digital makes possible lossless copying and dissemination, whereas analog technology cannot be copied without exposure to entropic decay (noise). If you record your voice with an old-school analogue tape recorder, then play that tape and record it with a second tape recorder, and so on, eventually your voice will be impossible to hear. Obviously, this is not so with the digital, as the thousandth copy of an MP3 is just as good as the "original."

The reason we have discussed in detail the distinguishing features of digitalism is that it helsp us to see how the information revolution increased the incentives for instrumental rationality relative to substantive rationality. The above-mentioned features of digitalism are instrumental refinements, which generate economies of scale for applications of instrumental rationality. However, applications of substantive rationality (e.g. ethical reflection on the ideal way of life, authentic interpersonal dialogue such as the confessional) do not permit economies of scale, almost by definition, because they are not productive. They already traffic in the infinite. Ironically, through the digital bypassing of the infinite via discrete reduction, cyberspace becomes an artificial infinity, in which instrumental sophistication becomes infinite. Consider the phenomenal achievement of Amazon's supply chain logistics. Predictive analytics leveraging a vast reservoir of globally collected consumer information makes it possible to deliver commodities to consumers before they even order them. Such new gains to be had by the instrumental increased the opportunity costs of being non- or anti-instrumental.

## Skill-biased technological change, continued

To understand this better, it is easiest to begin with a robustly demonstrated empirical phenomenon: skill-biased technological change. (Cite card et al) Skill-biased technological change (SBTC) is defined as "a shift in the production technology that favors skilled over unskilled labor by increasing its relative productivity and, therefore, is relative demand.)" (CITE The new Palgrave dictionary of economics). Some economists estimate that SBTC was responsible for over 40% of the increase in inequality since the 1980s.

Here is the basic rationale and some data points consistent with this idea. Basic economics suggest that skill and capital are complementary, which means that possessing one increases the value of the other. (Cite griliches 1969) High-skill, high-education workers are more likely to use computers on the job (cite Kruger 1993). Wage inequality begins to increase in the early 1980s right after the advent of microcomputers (Katz 1999) As with any complex political-economic phenomenon, the evidence is mixed and the case for SBTC is far from shut (many scholars dispute its causal significance). The point, for us, is to use this well-developed, formal idea, and the plausible economic rationale behind it, to think through a few other possibly similar tears in the social fabric. In short, technological changes have different effects on different people depending on individual-level differences. If we could look at data on other individual traits such as intelligence and personality, we would likely find a pattern similar to the one that SBTC finds for skills. Intelligence and personality traits are very similar to skills in their economic significance. The personality trait Conscientiousness, in particular, is a strong predictor of success (instrumental) in many domains. Skills, intelligence, capital, conscientiousness--again, all of these load on the instrumental dimension of human life.

Another example of a parallel pattern is the effect of increasing media choice, as shown by the political scientist Markus Prior (CITE). Prior finds that the rise of cable television caused an increase in inequality with respect to political knowledge and political participation. Cable television increased media choice (CNN vs. Fox News vs. cartoons, all over a 24 hour cycle). This allowed politically sophisticated individuals to become more politically sophisticated and politically disengaged individuals to become more disengaged. It is an effect that is structurally similar to SBTC but in the domain of cultural consumption and political behavior. Again, it is specifically advances in information technology that exacerbate pre-existing differences in capacity and temperament. 


## Ethically-biased technological change

Insert my bits from the information revolution paper

The theory of ethically biased technological change may also be able to account for other historical changes that are generally thought of as separate. For instance, consider the phenomenon that is called "neoliberalism." Neoliberalism is an ideologically loaded term, as it's generally used as a pejorative by left-wing individuals. Empirically, "neoliberalism" generally refers to a tendency, beginning in the late 1970s, for right-wing intellectuals and politicians in many countries around the world to favor dismantling welfare states in favor of free trade, lower taxes, low inflation, and privatization of public services. Thatcher in 1979 and Reagan in 1980 are typically the figureheads. Also in the global south, figures such as Pinochet in 1973. The left-wing conventional wisdom is that there was a significant and somewhat coordinated right-wing effort to change the political culture (see the Mount Pelerin Society; Milton Friedman gave counsel to Pinochet, etc). The right-wing generally argues that neoliberalism is a vague and meaningless term leftists use to attack everything they dislike since the 1970s, which right-wing people see as the inevitable lessons of capitalist reality correcting and disciplining the leftist fantasies of the postwar period. What leftists call neoliberalism the right calls simple market dynamics. Again, I beleive that a high-level conceptualization of techonomic acceleration helps us to see that both of these diagnoses refer to the same phenomenon: material, technological and economic changes--specifically, advances in information processing power--caused increasingly rapid learning about the state of the world by those most likely to seek learning; it increased the broadcasting power of those most likely to seek the dissemination of their messages; it increased the social selection efficiency (basically, the "pickiness" one could afford, such as moving to the suburbs, only marrying political partisans, etc.); it empowered the relatively compassionate and open–to-experience individuals to more radically oppose injustice and inequality, through radical protest (the "New Left," the SDS, etc.); it also empowered those with low-conscientiousness, the unskilled, and the disagreeable to cheat and commit crimes in new ways the police could not keep up with (airplane hi-jacking in the 1970s; bank heists; etc.). Perhaps most importantly, and most ruinously for normal people, it allowed the super-skilled, hyper-intelligent, super-conscientious elite to not only profit but also escape the box of national redistributive mechanisms. As Petrova shows, economic inequality causes media capture (CITE). Global trade and banking leads to global tax evasion. That all these vectors of wealth-escape were caused by a few reactionary politicians who wanted to dismantle the welfare state--this becomes hard to take very seriously. Much more likely, in light of this higher-level narrative, is that figures such as Reagan and Thatcher were themselves generated by much deeper, tectonic shifts that led national economic elites to escape all of their boxes (electorally, internationally, criminally, etc.) The information revolution was an explosion, and what is called "neoliberalism" is just the flood gates falling down.

The opening of the flood gates also had progressive implications, at least initially. The information revolution was a  necessary, if not sufficient, condition for the the radical democratic energy of the 1960s. Research has shown that the national shift of public opinion in favor of the civil rights movement was mediated by sympathetic television audiences (CITE). The extraordinary number of inner-city race riots in the 1960s showed a contagious quality, which appears to have been due to television. More generally, the 1960s saw the rise of national-scale youth culture, made possible by mass broadcast technology. As the psychologist Steven Pinker tells of his own experience at the time, speaking of the 1960s:

> The baby boomers were bonded by another new technology of solidarity, first marketed by an obscure Japanese company called Sony: the transistor radio. The parents of today who complain about the iPods and cell phones that are soldered onto the ears of teenagers forget that their own parents made the same complaint about them and their transistor radios. I can still remember the thrill of tuning in to signals from New York radio stations bouncing off the late-night ionosphere into my bedroom in Montreal, listening to Motown and Dylan and the British invasion and psychedelia and feeling that something was happening here, but Mr. Jones didn’t know what it was.

Later, cases such as the Rodney King case emerged because of advances in consumer information-technology, to which the police were not yet savvy (handheld video recorders, for instance). Of course, not all of the social upheaval of the 1960s can be interpreted as democratic protest upheaval. There was also a significant and ghastly crime wave throughout the 1960s (including homicide, rape, robbery, etc). Reactionary politicians from Nixon (1968), to Reagan (1980), to Bush I (1988), were all responding to the public demand for law and order in response to the upheavals of the 1960s. In the UK there was no such extraordinary crime wave, although there was a marginal increase in homicide through the 1970s and highly disruptive trade union strikes. The surge of economic inequality that begins in the 1980s, the electoral appearance of "neoliberal" politicians such as Thatcher and Reagan, are actually tail-end consequences of a much larger tendency in which, from the 1960s onward, the more instrumentally inclined individuals escaped the social dynamics they disliked. They could read and make statistical inferences about which neighborhoods in which cities in which states were most attractive to them; they could search, study, select, and plan to move their families to be in the neighborhoods they liked, with people like them. Just as the SDS could foment radical left politics nation-wide for the first time, those who were comfortable with the political system and only wanted to pursue their own prosperity, were off doing the same thing, in their own interests. At first, everyone can do this, but with each iteration of this social game we should predict that the less instrumental will have less players standing and the more instrumental will have more players standing. The reactionary politics of the 1980s, called neoliberalism, consists of only so many correlated consequences of this process. 

At first, the information revolution allowed a diverse flowering of various personality types, but this would not have been sustainable in equilibrium. As most individuals generally cannot have high-level predictions about the long-term consequences of their choices in a complex system (we can only see them now in retrospect, as hindsight is 20/20). What would've been rational and attractive for various individuals in the 1960s, in the short-term window relevant to their particular lifespans, may very well have contradicted what they would have desired for society as a whole in the long-run beyond their lifespan. In short, it seems to me that while the information technology explosion produced an initial opportunity for everyone to feel confident in their own visions of the future, the ultimate consequences would be the nearly complete saturation of culture by instrumental rationality. Why? Well, if substantive rationality is about choosing which games you want to play, instrumental rationality is the ability to win games. The reason the democratic upheavals of the 1960s failed is that substantive rationalists (e.g. SDS), tried to compete with instrumental rationalists, which by definition would be on instrumental terms. Substantive rationalists cannot win that game. Of course, the reason why substantive rationalists feel compelled to play that game is because it would seem that if they do not, then they remain powerless, hidden, impotent and ineffective. So substantive rationalists almost always feel they must enter onto the instrumental plane or go extinct. What they don't realize is that entering on the instrumental plane is also just as good as going extinct, for they are doomed there. The solution to this seeming aporia for substantive rationalist social reformers will be discussed later.<label for='sn-id-foreshadow-solution' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'></label><input type='checkbox' id='sn-id-foreshadow-solution' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='sidenote'>in short: organized power and "voice" is not needed to change society, substantive rationality has its own mysterious ways of changing the world in legitimately concrete and serious ways, they are only hard to see for we who have become instrumentalized; this is the great and guiding realization of Gilles Deleuze, I believe. </span> As information technology allows people to choose their own games, that's great, in the short run, but the skills needed to make your preferred game last, to make it define the larger social game, are unequally distributed. That will be determined by those with the superior application of instrumental rationality. It's almost tautological: if instrumental rationality and intelligence are essentially the ability to win games, then those who are more suited to it will always be the last players standing.

This also explains why left-wing politics has taken the course it has since the 1970s. It is exactly what we would predict from people who are ethically and temperamentally opposed to instrumental rationality, but whose big, grand gamble to replace the instrumental macro-tendencies with substantively rational tendencies failed. In the aftermath of the revolutionary New Left's defeat, simple old-fashioned survival will require an increasingly brutal instrumental rationality, precisely what left-wing individuals are not suited for. The proliferation of substantive culture can no longer be afforded, and it demonstrably failed in the grand push of the 1960s, so nobody can really beleive in it, anyway. So what will they do? The bulk of them will use their moderate intelligence to organize the less intelligent against intelligence as such. It is doomed not to work, because you can't defeat intelligence in a competitive game, and yet it is rational for them given their constraints, because it is their only way to not be replaced by robots.

Ultimately, it seems that the solution to this still ongoing macrosocial conundrum will either be increasingly brutal social war in which techonomic elites leave most people behind to spend all of their waking life fighting on social media for cultural-institutional privi, or some type of social pact in which those disadvantaged and competitive hyper capitalism, who are smart enough to read social havoc through deception for their own self protection, can be insured a decent life. On the other hand, those who would have to supply it, the wealthy, must be convinced that such a safety net will not simply empower resentful souls to destroy society even more. In subsequent weeks I will try to think more about this. I think one promising path lies in combining the idea of recognizing legitimate hierarchy and authority, giving deserved respect to objective forms of superiority (as concession from the left) and the wealthy increasing the social safety net (. In other words, engineering a new noblesse oblige. What is attractive about this is that it can be tested in small groups autonomously as a model that could then spread as a generalized social pact.
