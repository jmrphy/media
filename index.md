This site organizes the lecture notes for my 2017 class on the politics of media, information, and technology at the University of Southampton. 

My homepage is [jmrphy.net](http://jmrphy.net). You can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jmrphy), [Youtube](http://youtube.com/justinmurphy), [Tumblr](http://jmrphy.tumblr.com), and a few other places. I put out a podcast called [Other Life](http://jmrphy.libsyn.com) and [a newsletter of private letters, new work, and updates on my projects](http://tinyletter.com/jmrphy).

The site was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Tuft theme](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll). The two-column design was inspired by the work of [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte).
